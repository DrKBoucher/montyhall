Description: This replicates the door game where there are three doors for a player to choose from, one that has a car behind it and two that have goats. The player picks a door, then the host opens another door to reveal a goat, and then the player chooses to to stay with their original selection or switch to the other unopened door. The player is determined a winner if the final door selection has a car behind it. It then loops the game multiple times to calculate the probability of winning or losing based on whether the player stays with the original door or picks a different door in the end.
